# OOP Calculator v. 0.05 #
*A very specific tool for a very frustrating problem.*

### What? ###
OOP Calculator is a simple Android application designed to solve a very specific problem:
When a patient reaches their Out of Pocket Maximum (OOP) on a single line of an health insurance claim, then that line will need to be split. A portion will pay out at the patient's regular co-insurance percentage and the remainder will pay out at 100%.

This application likely serves no purpose outside the thrilling world of healthcare claims adjustment.

### How do I get set up? ###
The application requires a minimum Android SDK of 16 and the apk *should* run without issue.

### TODO ###
* **Likely:** Support for deductibles and copays when they apply to the OOP Maximum. 
* **Likely:** Support for recognizing when the split occurs in the deductible or copay.
* **Less Likely:** Support for coordinating benefits with Medicare or other commercial insurance.
